I am a Ph.D. candidate at the UC Berkeley Department of Earth and Planetary Science. 

My research primarily uses field observations, laboratory experiments, and statistical methods to understand Earth history. In particular, I integrate rock magnetic, paleomagnetic, geochronologic and thermochronologic data to understand ancient Earth magmatism, reconstruct paleogeography, and study the evolution of Earth's magnetic field and interior. 

I have conducted a total of 18 weeks of original field work since the beginning of my Ph.D. course. My field areas include the Lake Superior Region (MN, MI, WI) where I study igneous and sedimentary rocks associated with the ca. 1109-1083 Ma North American Midcontinent Rift, the ca. 1.08 Ga Pikes Peak granite in Colorado, the ca. 1.1 Ga Southwest Large Igneous Province (Death Valley, CA; Grand Canyon, AZ), and the Adirondack Mountains (NY) where I study their exhumation history and associated paleogeographic records using metamorphic rocks of the Grenville Province. 

For my paleomagnetism research, I conduct experiments at the UC Berkeley Paleomagnetism Lab which has a 2G DC-SQUID rock magnetometer and a quantum diamond microscope. In summer 2022, I attended the rock magnetism summer school at the Institute for Rock Magnetism at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. 

I also use a suite of techniques and instruments including X-ray powder diffraction for bulk compositional analysis, making custom thin sections for optical petrography, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to collect compositional (EDS) and crystal orientation (EBSD) information of minerals, and performing heavy mineral separation to obtain accessory minerals for geochronology and thermochronology.
