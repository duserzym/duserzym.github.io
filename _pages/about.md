I am a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley Department of Earth and Planetary Science. 

My research primarily uses field observations, laboratory experiments on rock magnetism, and statistical methods to understand Earth history. In particular, I integrate rock magnetic data, paleomagnetic records, geochronology and thermochronology data to understand ancient Earth magmatism , paleogeography evolution, and the evolution of Earth magnetic field and Earth interior. 

I have conducted a total of 18 weeks of original field work since the beggining of my Ph.D. course. My field study areas include the Lake Superior Region (MN, MI, WI) where I study igneous and sedimentary rocks associated with the ca. 1109-1083 Ma North American Midcontinent Rift, the ca. 1.08 Ga Pikes Peak granite in Colorado, the ca. 1.1 Ga Southwest Large Igneous Province (Death Valley, CA; Grand Canyon, AZ), and the Adirondack Mountains (NY) where I study the exhumation history and associated paleogeography records of the metamorphic rocks of the Grenville Province. 

Specifically for my paleomagnetism research, I conduct experiments at the UC Berkeley paleomagnetism lab which has a 2G DC-SQUID rock magnetometer and a quantum diamond microscope. In summer 2022, I attended the rock magnetism summer school at the Institute for Rock Magnetism at Univeristy of Minnesota Twin Cities. 

I also use a suite of techniques and instruments including X-ray powder diffraction for bulk compositional analysis, making custom thin sections for optical petrography, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to collect compositional (EDS) and crystal orientation information  (EBSD) of minerals, performing heavy mineral separation to obtain accessory minerals for geochornology and thermochronology experiments.
