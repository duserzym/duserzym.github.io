@article{Wenk2025a,
	abstract = {Serpentine minerals have received a lot of attention because of their unique crystal structures, their wide occurrence in orogenic belts and their potential role in contributing seismic anisotropy in subducting slabs. Several studies have investigated crystal preferred orientation (CPO) in high temperature antigorite serpentinites from Japan, the Alps, Spain, Cuba and Tibet, documenting significant crystal alignment. However, only a limited number of lower grade serpentines have been explored to date. Mainly because of submicroscopic microstructural heterogeneities CPO cannot be measured with conventional methods such as optical microscopy and EBSD. In this study 15 serpentinites from different tectonic settings in California, the Central Alps and Northern Spain have been investigated, mainly with high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction, to quantify bulk crystal alignment. We find that CPO is strong on sheared surfaces of fractured blocks and secondary veins but the bulk of most serpentinite samples, except high-grade recrystallized antigorite serpentinite, show only weak crystal alignment. Correspondingly calculated seismic anisotropy based on CPO is not very significant. This is supported by very heterogeneous microstructures as documented with SEM and TEM analyses.},

@article{Zhang2024a,
	abstract = {Abstract The paleogeography of Laurentia throughout the Neoproterozoic is critical for reconstructing global paleogeography due to its central position in the supercontinent Rodinia. We develop a new paleomagnetic pole from red siltstones and fine-grained sandstones of the early Neoproterozoic Jacobsville Formation which is now constrained to be ca. 990 Ma in age. High-resolution thermal demagnetization experiments resolve detrital remanent magnetizations held by hematite. These directions were reoriented within siltstone intraclasts and pass intraformational conglomerate tests---giving confidence that the magnetization is detrital and primary. An inclination-corrected mean paleomagnetic pole position for the Jacobsville Formation indicates that Laurentia's motion slowed down significantly following the onset of the Grenvillian orogeny. Prior rapid plate motion associated with closure of the Unimos Ocean between 1,110 and 1,090 Ma transitioned to slow drift of Laurentia across the equator in the late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic. We interpret the distinct position of this well-dated pole from those in the Grenville orogen that have been assigned a similar age to indicate that the ages of the poles associated with the Grenville Loop likely need to be revised to be younger due to prolonged exhumation.},

@article{Gallo2023a,
	abstract = {Abstract Our understanding of Earth's paleogeography relies heavily on paleomagnetic apparent polar wander paths (APWPs), which represent the time-dependent position of Earth's spin axis relative to a given block of lithosphere. However, conventional approaches to APWP construction have significant limitations. First, the paleomagnetic record contains substantial noise that is not integrated into APWPs. Second, parametric assumptions are adopted to represent spatial and temporal uncertainties even where the underlying data do not conform to the assumed distributions. The consequences of these limitations remain largely unknown. Here, we address these challenges with a bottom-up Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation scheme that operates on site-level paleomagnetic data. To demonstrate our methodology, we present an extensive compilation of site-level Cenozoic paleomagnetic data from North America, which we use to generate a high-resolution APWP. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of substantial noise, polar wandering can be assessed with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution.},
